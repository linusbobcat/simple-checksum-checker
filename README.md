# Simple Checksum Checker

This is a simple front end to verify shasums for OS X. It takes an ISO file and a shasum and then tells you whether or not they're the same. It's written in Applescript.


## System Requirements
It runs on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and above. Run it manually from Applescript on anything below that.
